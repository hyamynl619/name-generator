## Part 1 of the Impractical Python Projects book

# Random Name Generator

In this section I will be attempting to generate first and last names to create 
characters for an anime called, "My Hero Academia."

This is a warm up section to get my brain to remember the Pep8 style and to use
just basic system packages included with Python.

# How to Play

This is a text-based game that'll prompt yes or no questions.
The screen will ask the player if they would like to figure out their Hero name before
moving forward. 
If the player select yes then the game will randomize a name and will display their Hero
name in RED. 
The screen will prompt if the player would like to play again.
